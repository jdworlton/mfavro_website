            <h1>100 Words About Me</h1>
            <p>When I tell people I’m a software engineer, and I have a writing background, they invariably act surprised.<br/> To me, the combination of technical and writing skills makes perfect sense.</p>
            <p> During my master’s program I studied the value of presenting information in ways that help people understand the message.<br/> This was usually through words on a page. But my experience as a developer 
                has taught me the value of effectively communicating <br/>on a mobile screen, or a browser window. My skills in both worlds inspire me to create interesting, effective, and useful experiences on the web.</p> 
                <p>Enjoy exploring my portfolio.</p>
